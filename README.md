# mushroom-classifier - A deep-learning based Web-Application for mushroom classification.
This project aims to provide a web-application that classifies uploaded images of mushrooms. Due to lack of computational power, I decided to limit myself to classify 10 species only:
1. Apioperdon pyriforme
2. Auricularia auricula-judae
3. Dacrymyces stillatus
4. Daedalea quercina
5.Fuscoporia ferrea
6. Psathyrella candolleana
7. Stereum hirsutum
8. Tremella mesenterica
9. Tubaria furfuracea
10. Xylaria hypoxylon
## How did I approach this project?

### 1. Do some preprocessing


### 2. Build the model(s)


### 3. Create a web-application using Flask and TensorFlow.js

The (for now) final model was converted into TensorFlow.js format and integrated into a simple web-framework using Flask and Bootstrap.
